##  Project Overview
A Python-based financial tool designed to automate Goods and Services Tax (GST) calculations. This program takes a raw amount as input and generates a detailed billing breakdown, separating the base cost from the tax component.

## ⚙️ Key Features
 Logic: Built using Python functions (`def`) to ensure code reusability and clean architecture.
* **Detailed Breakdown:** specific output that displays:
    * Original Bill Amount
    * GST Amount (Calculated)
    * Final Net Payable Amount
  User benefit: Simple command-line interface for instant calculation.

## Technologies used:
*Language:* Python 3.x
* Concepts: Functions, Arithmetic Operations, and Input/Output Handling.

## Logic & Efficiency
The program avoids repetition and simplifies the bill for the user. This reduces the complexity from a manual calculation to a single function call, ensuring accuracy and speed.

##  Example Output

Enter the Amount: 1000


--------------------------
